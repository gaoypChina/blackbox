How to remove from GitHub tracking:

Add to .gitignore

For files:

$ git rm --cached file1 file2 file3

For folders:

$ git rm --cached -r folder_name_1 folder_name_2

Commit, and if files and folders are unchecked, check them and make sure it says "#x files deleted" somewhere in the dialog.

Push. They will now be deleted from remote (but can be found in history).
