# Launch Screen Assets

You can customize the launch screen with your own desired assets by replacing the image files in this directory.

You can also do it by opening your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, selecting `Runner/Assets.xcassets` in the Project Navigator and dropping in the desired images.

Karolina changed the row below in LaunchScreen.storyboard from:
<color key="backgroundColor" red="1" green="1" blue="1" alpha="1" colorSpace="custom" customColorSpace="sRGB"/>

to:
<color key="backgroundColor" red="0" green="0" blue="0" alpha="1" colorSpace="custom" customColorSpace="sRGB"/>

Karolina also changed the LaunchImage.imageset to custom images (all of the same size, because
I thinkt they they are too small and I can't make them bigger...)
